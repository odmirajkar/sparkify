# Sparkify-Project Readme

### Summary of project
Project is aout a hypothetical application sparkify which is music steaming app. Sparkify is an app similar to Spotify and the dataset contains user behaviour log for the past few months. 
Goal is to idenfiy customer churn, these are customer which are either cancelling their service or downgrading thier service


 
### Project Motivation
Apart from running basic classification problem , I decided to use this project as an oppurtunity to explore Spark.I created my own learning goal and that is to compare between Pandas dataframe and spark dataframe APIS. also in spark whether to use spark sql or spark declaritive APIS. 
   
### Libriries used
1. Spark - for data processing and machine learning
	- I have used spark functions like isnan, udf, window etc
	- Also spark sql 
	- and clasification algorithm like RandomForestClassifier,GBTClassifier
2. Pandas
	- for pada processing , mainly used to compare with Spark
6. matplotlib
	- This is used for data visualization


### File Contents:
1. Sparkify.ipynb is the main notebook where we do all the preprocessing, feature engineering and modelling.
